# Question :
```python
Alice has a binary string. She thinks a binary string is beautiful if and only if it doesn't contain the substring .

In one step, Alice can change a  to a  or vice versa. Count and print the minimum number of steps needed to make Alice see the string as beautiful.

Example


She can change any one element and have a beautiful string.

Function Description

Complete the beautifulBinaryString function in the editor below.

beautifulBinaryString has the following parameter(s):

string b: a string of binary digits
Returns

int: the minimum moves required
Input Format

The first line contains an integer , the length of binary string.
The second line contains a single binary string .

Constraints

.
Output Format

Print the minimum number of steps needed to make the string beautiful.

Sample Input 0

STDIN       Function
-----       --------
7           length of string n = 7
0101010     b = '0101010'
Sample Output 0

Make the string beautiful by changing  characters ( and ).

Sample Input 1

5
01100
Sample Output 1

0
Sample Case 1:

In this sample 

Explanation 1

The substring  does not occur in , so the string is already beautiful in  moves.

Sample Input 2

10
0100101010
Sample Output 2

3
Explanation 2

In this sample 

One solution is to change the values of  to form a beautiful string.
```
------------------------------
# Solution:
```python
def beautifulBinaryString(b):
    changes  = 0
    i = 0
    while i < len(b)-2:
        if b[i:i+3] == '010':
            changes += 1
            i += 3
        else:
            i += 1
    return changes
```
